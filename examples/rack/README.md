# Opal Rack example

This example uses a simple rack server, along with sprockets to serve
the assets. Sprockets makes opal easy to use, and is the basis for
integration with rails (via opal-rails).

## Running

Install dependencies (opal):

```
$ bundle install
```

Run rack server:

```
$ bundle exec rackup
```
